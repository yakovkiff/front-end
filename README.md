Alternatively, it can be played on a local machine by cloning this repo, navigating to the directory, and starting a web server. (Mac users can enter "http-server" to start a JS server.)

The snake starts as a single square in a bordered container. As it moves forward and eats things, additional squares are added on behind the head, which creates a trailing tail that resembles a moving snake.  

The game is over when the snake dies,either by running ito itself or the borders of box.
